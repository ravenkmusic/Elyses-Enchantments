As a magician-to-be, Elyse needs to practice some basics. She has a stack of cards that she wants to manipulate.

To make things a bit easier she only uses the cards 1 to 10 so her stack of cards can be represented by an array of numbers. The position of a certain card corresponds to the index in the array. That means position 0 refers to the first card, position 1 to the second card etc.

All functions should update the array of cards and then return the modified array - a common way of working known as the Builder pattern, which allows you to nicely daisy-chain functions together.
